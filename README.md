# Code Discussion

Please clone this repo locally, and checkout testq.ts... you can see some types and a few questions... make a branch locally called {your-name}, answer up to the bonus questions and make a pr.

We can talk about that pr, and then you can pick a bonus question to discuss or... to do if you feel like it.
